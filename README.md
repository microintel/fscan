Micro-Scanner

Micro-Scanner is a lightweight web tool designed to assess the security of URLs. Developed by Microintel, it provides a quick and easy way to check whether a website is genuine or potentially insecure.

How It Works
Upon pasting a URL into the input field and clicking the "Check" button, Micro-Scanner processes the input and performs the following steps:

Input URLs: "marvel.com" (genuine) and "marval.com" (insecure).
Domain Extraction: Extracts domain names: "marvel.com" and "marval.com".
Domain Comparison: Compares with trusted list:
"marvel.com" matches trusted sites.
"marval.com" doesn't match.
Result Display:
"marvel.com": Confirms genuine.
"marval.com": Warns of insecurity.
Additionally, it shows a visual indicator, such as an image, to highlight the insecure status for "marval.com".
User Action:
Proceed with "marvel.com".
Caution with "marval.com".
By following these steps, the Micro-Scanner tool helps users quickly assess the security status of URLs and make safer browsing decisions.

Purpose
